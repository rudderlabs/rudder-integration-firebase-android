[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) is a **customer data pipeline tool** for collecting, routing and processing data from your websites, apps, cloud tools, and data warehouse.

With RudderStack, you can build customer data pipelines that connect your whole customer data stack and then make them smarter by triggering enrichment and activation in customer tools based on analysis in your data warehouse. Its easy-to-use SDKs and event source integrations, Cloud Extract integrations, transformations, and expansive library of destination and warehouse integrations makes building customer data pipelines for both event streaming and cloud-to-warehouse ELT simple.
